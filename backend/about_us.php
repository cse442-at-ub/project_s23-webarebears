    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
    Welcome to Room8, the app designed to help college roommates live together! Our app was created by a team of college students who understand the challenges of sharing a living space with others. We know firsthand how difficult it can be to coordinate tasks, split bills, and stay organized with roommates, and we wanted to create a solution to make things easier.

At Room8, our mission is to help roommates live together more harmoniously. Our app features a variety of tools to help you communicate, stay organized, and manage your finances with ease. With Room8, you can assign tasks to your roommates, set due dates, and get notifications when tasks are completed. You can also split bills directly through the app, so there's no need to keep track of who owes what. And with our group chat feature, you can stay connected with your roommates and communicate about household matters easily.

We believe that living with roommates should be a positive experience, and we're committed to making that a reality for as many people as possible. Whether you're a college student or a young professional, Room8 can help you live more harmoniously with your roommates. Try it out today and see how it can change your living situation for the better!
